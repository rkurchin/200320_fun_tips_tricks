# Software and other tools/interfaces

## Beautiful monospace font: Source Code Pro!
<screenshot>
Ligatures are so cool! I have this font set up in iTerm, Atom, and Matlab.

## CLI: [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com) with [oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh)
**Why?** easily customizable interface, prompts, shortcuts, easy-to-add extra commands, etc.

(How did I make that cool GIF, you ask? [This nifty tool!](https://giphy.com/apps/giphycapture))

## IDE/code editing: [Atom](https://atom.io)
**Why?** Super customizable with packages, themes, autocompletes, etc.
### Useful Atom packages
* For Julia: `uber-juno` package to get workspace, plots, REPL, etc.
* For Python: Hydrogen package to spin up Jupyter kernels within Atom and run from source code (caveat: doesn't always play nice with Juno)
* For HPC: `ftp-remote-edit` to connect to remote machines and edit files within Atom (Thanks Varun/Alec!)
* convenience: `file-icons` for nice "visual grepping"
* for local LaTeX: I mostly use Overleaf, but on planes or whatever, `latex` + `pdf-view` packages turn Atom into a nice TeX environment too
* for little tests: `platformio-ide-terminal` spawn up little terminal windows inside Atom
* syntax highlighting and autocomplete packages for various languages...

## Note-taking: [Bear](https://bear.app)
**Why?** Super pretty, tags rather than folders, Markdown formatting.

## Professional identity: interoperable personal website and CV code – feel free to fork as template for your own stuff!
* website: https://github.com/rkurchin/rkurchin.github.io (based on academicpages template)
* CV: https://github.com/rkurchin/Kurchin_CV (pulls from same source files as CV sections)


## Citation management
* personally I like [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org): lots of plugins, flexible file management, decent BibTeX integration, open source
* https://doi2bib.org/ is also a super useful tool for one-off citations

# Text editing shortcuts, etc.
As much as you can keep your hands on the keyboard, the more efficient and comfortable you are!
* moving around: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd> (beginning of line), <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>e</kbd> (end of line), <kbd>Alt</kbd> + arrows to skip around by "words"
* multiline indent: <kbd>⌘</kbd> + [ or ] (thanks Venkat!)
* in iTerm: <kbd>⌘</kbd> + click to follow links to files, URL's, etc.
* multiple cursors in Atom! <kbd>⌘</kbd> + click at each point to create cursor (thanks Alec!)

# "Life Hacks" for productivity, etc.
Key philosophy: make habits you can stick to. This means finding (or making!) the tool that does what you want, and not adapting your life around the tool!

* Email distraction-busting: unroll.me or similar, also full-screen mode
* To-do list app of some kind to offload mental load: I've tried Wunderlist (now defunct :( ), Trello, and most recently I like ClickUp

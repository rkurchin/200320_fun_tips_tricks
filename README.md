# Software and other tools/interfaces

## Beautiful monospace font: Source Code Pro!
<screenshot>
Ligatures are so cool! I have this font set up in iTerm, Atom, and Matlab.

## CLI: [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com) with [oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh)
**Why?** easily customizable interface, prompts, shortcuts, easy-to-add extra commands, etc.

(How did I make that cool GIF, you ask? [This nifty tool!](https://giphy.com/apps/giphycapture))

## IDE/code editing: [Atom](https://atom.io)
**Why?** Super customizable with packages, themes, autocompletes, etc.
### Useful Atom packages
* For Julia: `uber-juno` package to get workspace, plots, REPL, etc.
* For Python: Hydrogen package to spin up Jupyter kernels within Atom and run from source code (caveat: doesn't always play nice with Juno)
* For HPC: `ftp-remote-edit` to connect to remote machines and edit files within Atom (Thanks Varun/Alec!)
* convenience: `file-icons` for nice "visual grepping"
* for local LaTeX: I mostly use Overleaf, but on planes or whatever, `latex` + `pdf-view` packages turn Atom into a nice TeX environment too
* for little tests: `platformio-ide-terminal` spawn up little terminal windows inside Atom
* syntax highlighting and autocomplete packages for various languages...

## Note-taking: [Bear](https://bear.app)
**Why?** Super pretty, tags rather than folders just makes sense, Markdown formatting.

## Professional identity: interoperable personal website and CV code – feel free to fork as template for your own stuff!
* website: https://github.com/rkurchin/rkurchin.github.io (based on academicpages template)
* CV: https://github.com/rkurchin/Kurchin_CV (pulls from same source files as CV sections)


## Citation management
* personally I like [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org): lots of plugins, flexible file management, decent BibTeX integration, open source
* https://doi2bib.org/ is also a super useful tool for one-off citations

# Text editing shortcuts, etc.
As much as you can keep your hands on the keyboard, the more efficient and comfortable you are! There are definitely lots more of these I just haven't internalized as yet, but these are some I use frequently in addition to the very commonly known ones for cut/copy/paste, select all, etc.
* moving around: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd> (beginning of line), <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd> (end of line), <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>← →</kbd> to skip around by "words"
* multiline indent: <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>[</kbd> or <kbd>]</kbd> (thanks Venkat!)
* in iTerm: <kbd>⌘</kbd> + click to follow links to files, URL's, etc.
* multiple cursors in Atom! <kbd>⌘</kbd> + click at each point to create cursor (thanks Alec!)

# "Life Hacks" for productivity, etc.
Key philosophy: make habits you can stick to. This means finding (or making!) the tool that does what you want (and, as much as possible, matches how you think), and not adapting your life around the tool!

* Email distraction-busting: [unroll.me](https://unroll.me) or similar, also full-screen mode
* To-do list app of some kind to offload mental load: I've tried Wunderlist (now defunct :cry: ), [Trello](https://trello.com), and most recently I like [ClickUp](https://www.clickup.com): personally, I like the ability to have different "statuses" for tasks, in particular for anything that requires external input, to keep track of whose court the metaphorical ball is currently in
* [Some of my philosophizing on this subject](https://rkurchin.github.io/posts/2020/02/do-not-finish) -- time management, etc.
